# JSIS-Engine
Engine to run instructions compiled together from JSIS code by the JSIS compiler

## For anyone interrested in how fast this engine actually is
I ran a test of printing 1000001 chars 100 times and these were the average times:
  ### C++20(clang 13):  62ms
  ### JSIS 1.0:         93ms
  ### Java 8:           787ms
